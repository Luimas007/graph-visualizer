# Graph Visualizer

A simple web-based tool to visualize graphs interactively. Users can input the number of vertices and edges, and the graph will be dynamically created and visualized in real-time. This project helps visualize graph structures with nodes and edges, making it easy to understand graph theory concepts and relationships between elements.
